- INFOGRAPHIC PROJECT;
- In this little project, I wanted to present for college I was required to present an Infographic for a non-programming class, but I have decided to create a small application with React to practice skills such as HTML, CSS React, and Git.🏫
- The main purpose of it is to start creating personal projects for myself and coding growth.🦾
- I used simple technologies  such as React and React Router alonsgside with HTML and CSS. 🛠
